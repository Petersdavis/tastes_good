		<h3>3. Placing an Order</h3>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Once you have selected the Restraurant, the Menu Items, the Extras, Delivery and Payment Options you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order by clicking or selecting the "proceed", "place my order" or similar button. It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so we will start processing your Order and errors cannot be corrected.</li>
			<li>Once you have submitted your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund. If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you should contact the Restaurant.</li>
			<li>Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed or communicated to the relevant Restaurant.</li>
			<li>On receipt of your Order, we will begin processing it by sending it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed. Please note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each merely indicate that your Order has been received and is being processed by us, and does not necessarily mean that your Order has been accepted by the Restaurant. We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order. However, Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>4. Order Payment</h3>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through Tastes-Good.com or in cash to the Restaurant at the point of delivery to you.</li>
			<li>If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card conforms with the receipt data for the Order. Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in payments taking up to sixty (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.</li>
			<li>Because of standard banking procedures, once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, your bank or card issuer will pre-authorize the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant amount back into your available balance. However, this may take a period of typically up to 5 working days (and in some cases up to 30 days, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.</li>
